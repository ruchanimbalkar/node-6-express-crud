# ðŸ’Ž Recipe API Challenge

## ðŸ“Œ Your Task

In this exercise, you'll build a **Recipes API** using **Express.js** and **Node.js**.

Your app should listen for and respond to all the API endpoints listed in the Recipe APIâ€™s [api-documentation.md](https://github.com/ac-backend/node-6-express-crud/blob/main/recipes-api/api-documentation.md) file.

For each API endpoint:
- Write a **helper function** that performs the logic (such as reading from or filtering the data).
- Call that helper function **inside** the endpoint.

---

## ðŸ§  Learning Goals

By the end of this exercise, you will be able to:

- Use boilerplate Express code to set up a server  
- Write API endpoints that handle **GET** requests  
- Use the `fs/promises` module to read data from a JSON file  
- Organize your code using **helper functions**
